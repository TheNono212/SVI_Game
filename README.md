# SVI_Game
industrial unity farming game

So you may know my precedent game "Pouletto".
It disappeared in the infinite existance of my old potato pc.

Now that I have a better computer, I finnaly can fully develop my game

It will be a Stardew Valley game like. But I will add some industrial things, I will also make the combat system more advance and maybe the mining gameplay even if I don't have idea rn...

(SVI = Stardew Valley Industrial)
